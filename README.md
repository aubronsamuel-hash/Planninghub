# PlanningHub

## 1. Project Overview
PlanningHub is an orchestration engine for time-based resources, positioned for neutral domains that require scheduling and allocation without assuming a specific industry.

## 2. Core Principle
Everything is a time reservation.
This principle defines the domain model and prioritizes temporal commitments over static assets. See docs/vision/product_vision.md.

## 3. Documentation Map
Authoritative sources live under docs/:
- Vision: docs/vision/
- Governance: docs/governance/
- Specifications: docs/specs/
- Roadmap: docs/roadmap/
- Project status: docs/status/

## 4. Governance & Codex Usage
This repository is governed. AGENT.md is authoritative and Codex MUST operate under strict rules. See docs/governance/codex_governance.md.

## 5. Project Status
Current phase: Phase 4 is in progress.
Implemented: documented domain contracts and ports and adapters skeletons through Phase 3.
Intentionally not implemented: framework wiring, scheduling heuristics, and Phase 5+ capabilities.
See docs/status/phase_status.md.

## 7. How to Contribute (Minimal)
