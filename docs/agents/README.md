# Agents

Agents are specialized collaborators that operate within defined scopes and follow the root orchestrator.

- The authoritative orchestrator is AGENT.md at the repository root.
- Agents are registered and updated in the Sub-Agents Registry section of AGENT.md.
- Any agent change must be logged in the AGENT CHANGELOG.

Available agents:
- [AGENT.backend](AGENT.backend.md): Backend changes and services.
- [AGENT.frontend](AGENT.frontend.md): UI and UX implementation.
- [AGENT.docs](AGENT.docs.md): Documentation updates under docs/**.
- [AGENT.devops](AGENT.devops.md): CI/CD, infra, and operational scripts.
- [AGENT.qa](AGENT.qa.md): Test planning and validation.
- [AGENT.data](AGENT.data.md): Data pipelines and models.
- [AGENT.security](AGENT.security.md): Security reviews and fixes.

If an agent needs scope changes or new responsibilities, update AGENT.md and record the change in the changelog.
