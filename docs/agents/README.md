# Agents

Agents are specialized collaborators that operate within defined scopes and follow the root orchestrator.

- The authoritative orchestrator is AGENT.md at the repository root.
- Agents are registered and updated in the Sub-Agents Registry section of AGENT.md.
- Any agent change must be logged in the AGENT CHANGELOG.

If an agent needs scope changes or new responsibilities, update AGENT.md and record the change in the changelog.
