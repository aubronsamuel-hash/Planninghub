# Decision Required: phase 4 status conflict

Date: 2026-01-20
Status: Proposed
Owners: documentation governance

## Context
- docs/roadmap/roadmap_v1.md defines Phase 4 as future framework wiring only.
- docs/audits/implementation_readiness.md reports Phase 4 as DONE with in-memory adapter guarantees.

## Options
1) Update the roadmap Phase 4 definition to match the audit status.
2) Update the audit Phase 4 status to align with the roadmap future definition.

## Decision
- DECISION REQUIRED

## Rationale
- Phase status must be consistent across the roadmap and audits to keep governance deterministic.

## Consequences
- Phase status documentation and downstream plans depend on the resolved definition.

## Update 2026-01-24
- Conflict remains unresolved, which blocks identifying the current active phase and
  any next allowed step until a decision is recorded.
