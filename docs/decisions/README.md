# Decisions

Decisions exist to resolve ambiguity, capture rationale, and keep the repository as the source of truth.

## Naming convention
- Use kebab-case with a date prefix: YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md

## When a decision is required
- Conflicting authority sources
- Unclear requirements or scope
- Blocking ambiguity in workflow or validation

Use the Decision Required template in AGENT.md when creating new decision files.
