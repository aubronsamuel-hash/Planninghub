# Decision Required: Missing scope for requested work

Date: 2025-09-06
Status: Proposed
Owners: Codex

## Context
- The request includes a placeholder for SCOPE but no actual scope was provided.
- Without scope, it is unclear which docs/specs or code paths are in-bounds.

## Options
1) Provide a concrete scope (files, features, or paths) to implement.
2) Confirm no changes are required (close as no-op).

## Decision
- DECISION REQUIRED

## Rationale
- Scope is required to identify authoritative specs and permitted paths.

## Consequences
- Work is blocked until scope is clarified.
