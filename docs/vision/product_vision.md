# Product vision

## What PlanningHub is
PlanningHub is the target product vision and functional architecture for a system that orchestrates modern work. The core statement is: PlanningHub is the nervous system of modern work. It defines engines for identity and access, time and reservation, conflict detection, execution and timesheet workflows, financial intelligence, automation, marketplace and trust, notifications, analytics, mobile offline, security, and integrations.

## What PlanningHub is not
- It is not the current implementation state. The current scope and order of delivery live in docs/roadmap/ and docs/audits/implementation_readiness.md.
- It is not limited to a single industry. The vision is multi vertical and applies across domains.

## Core principle
Everything is a time reservation with attached value.

## Neutral domain positioning
PlanningHub is intended for multi vertical use cases, not a single sector. Its core engines are domain neutral and apply to any organization that needs time and resource orchestration.
