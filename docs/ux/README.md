# UX Documentation

## Purpose
This folder captures PlanningHub UX intent and keeps UX artifacts aligned with
product vision and architecture.

## Vision Alignment
PlanningHub is the nervous system of modern work. The UX must make the core
principle explicit: every commitment is a time-based value reservation. The
experience should guide users from time chaos to precise orchestration.

## UX Principles
- Clarity over density: explain time, value, and resource impact.
- Trust through transparency: surface conflicts, constraints, and outcomes.
- Orchestration first: help users move from chaos to precise scheduling.
- Mobile first posture: key flows stay concise and resilient on small screens.

## Scope
This directory will evolve to include:
- Journey maps
- Information architecture
- Wireframes and interaction notes
- Accessibility and content guidelines
