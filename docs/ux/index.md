# UX Documentation Index

## Purpose
- Provide a stable home for UX documentation.
- Keep UX artifacts readable, deterministic, and aligned with glossary terms.
- Provide navigation and basic rules for future UX docs.

## UX Docs
- [UX documentation rules](ux_documentation_rules.md) - Requirements and constraints for UX docs.
- [Interaction primitives](interaction_primitives.md) - Read-only primitives used to describe views.
- [View templates](view_templates.md) - Templates for future UX docs.

## How to add a UX doc
- MUST place new UX docs under docs/ux/.
- MUST follow the required sections in ux_documentation_rules.md.
- MUST use glossary terms from docs/glossary/domain_terms.md.
- MUST keep statements deterministic (MUST, MUST NOT, MAY).
- MAY add a link in this index.
