# ADR-0003: Documentation authority and conflict resolution

Status: ACCEPTED

Context:
- Documentation authority order is defined for resolving conflicts.
- Conflicts must stop work and create a decision entry in docs/decisions using the AGENT template.
- Evidence: docs/governance/documentation_authority.md
- Evidence: AGENT.md

Decision:
- Documentation conflicts are resolved by the documented authority order, and conflicts require a decision entry in docs/decisions.

Rationale: NOT DOCUMENTED

Consequences:
- Documentation authority is recorded in docs/governance/documentation_authority.md.
- Decision entries use the template defined in AGENT.md under docs/decisions.
