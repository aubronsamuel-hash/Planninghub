# Governance Sync Log

Date: 2026-01-17

## Summary of changes
- Removed docs/agents/README.md from deprecated listings to keep the entry documentation active.
- Removed duplicate DO NOT DO content in implementation readiness to keep a single final gate.

## Rationale
These updates align governance with the vision doc and enforce a real readiness gate before implementation work.
