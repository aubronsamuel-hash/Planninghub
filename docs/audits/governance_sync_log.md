# Governance Sync Log

Date: 2026-01-17

## Summary of changes
- Clarified AGENT.md authority order and canonical vision note.
- Normalized the AGENT.md agent registry to the current docs/agents files.
- Hardened implementation readiness with baseline validation commands and explicit DECISION REQUIRED guidance.

## Rationale
These updates align governance with the vision doc and enforce a real readiness gate before implementation work.
